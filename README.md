# Family Watch Night

A cross-platform app for managing movie selection for a Family Watch Night

# Planned Features

- Track each family member's interest in movies to watch together
- Maintain your family's library of streaming services plus DVDs and Blu-rays (physical, ISO, and MKV)
- Integrate with TMDB to include ratings, reviews, artwork, etc. for all movies.
- Integrate with Watchmode to monitor availability of movies of interest across your family's available streaming services
- Present a unified interface to help select a movie for a family watch night across all local and available streaming sources.
- Automatically launch the appropriate web page or app-based player for the evening's movie.
- Establish persistent family-specific and family-member-specific filters to exclude search results by rating, genre, keyword, or individual title.
- (Hopefully) support time-based tagging of content (language, philosophy, violence, sexuality, etc.) and allow configuration for automatically muting, obscuring, skipping, or pausing for discussion over the kinds of content your family finds worthy of attention. (For web-based and VLC playback.)
